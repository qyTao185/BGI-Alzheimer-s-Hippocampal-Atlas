## Summary
We employed advanced high-resolution Stereo-seq, combined with single-nucleus sequencing techniques, to investigate gene expression and cell composition changes in the hippocampus in individuals with or without Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The resulting spatial transcriptomic map, achieved with single-cell precision, unveiled AD-associated alterations with spatial specificity, including: 1) elevated expression of synapse pruning genes in the fimbria of AD, accompanied by abnormal microglia-astrocyte communication likely leading to disorganized synaptic structure, 2) a globally increased energy generation in the CA, with varying degrees across its CA subregions, 3) a significant reduction in the number of CA1 neurons in AD, while CA4 neurons  remained largely unaffected, potentially due to gene alterations conferring resilience to AD, and 4) Aβ plaques aggregated in CA1 and SLRM subregions, and integration of the transcriptomic map with Aβ immunohistochemical staining revealed a sequential enrichment of microglia and astrocytes around Aβ plaques. Finally, we observed significant reduction in brain-derived extracellular vesicles carrying CCK and PMP2 in AD plasma, highlighting their potential as robust diagnostic tools for clinical applications.
